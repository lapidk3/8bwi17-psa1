2. Strings objects are immutable meaning that once they are created
their value cannot be changed. If one wanted to concatenate two strings
a new String object would have to be created, taking up more memory/space.
On the other Stringbuilders aren't immutable. You can add characters and
strings to a stringbuilder without having to create new objects. The
characters/strings will simple be added too the stringbuilder itself, saving
more space in the heap.

3. It was definitely easier and faster to code part B in contrast to part
A because they both had similar code impementations, but it was easier to 
add characters to the Stringbuilder object rather than the String object.
